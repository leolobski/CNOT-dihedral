# A Finite Presentation of CNOT-Dihedral Operators
<!-- ideas for the title: Normalising quantum circuits / Towards simplification of quantum circuits -->

We start the [Applied Category Theory Seminar](http://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/adjoint-school-act-2019/) with a discussion of the paper *A Finite Prsesentation of CNOT-Dihedral Operators* by Matthew Amy, Jianxin Chen and Niel J. Ross.

## Introduction

When trying to understand a new field, subject or theory, it is often useful to view it from as many angles as possible. In mathematics, this involves studying various representations of an object. The result of the paper, existence and uniqueness of a normal form for a fragment of quantum computation, was obtained by the authors observing an interesting interplay between two languages: on one hand we have the representation of quantum gates as circuits in a symmetric monoidal category (which is moreover a groupoid in this case), and on the other hand we can view the diagonal gates as `phase polynomials'. In this blog post, we add a third language to that, the ZX-calculus. This also serves the purpose of putting the work done in the paper into a broader contex, as the ZX-calculus is already implicit in the monoidal circuit representation; indeed, all the relations that hold for the gates in the paper are derivable in the ZX-calculus.

Algebraic theory of quantum circuits: logical vs reversible gates.
Logical gates (linear maps) have been axiomatised in the ZX and ZW calculi, these form compact closed monoidal categories.
An axiomatisation of unitary circuits, in the form of a symmetric monoidal groupoid, is a harder task. The circuit model for quantum computation is based on the universal set of unitaries $\{CNOT, X, T, H \}$, generating the Clifford+T gate set. Universality here means that we can get arbitrairily close to any $n$-qubit unitary using polynomially many gates.

Algebraic theories for restricted fragments:
* Lafont (2003): affine circuits $\{ CNOT, X \}$
* Selinger (2015): clifford groupoid $\{ CNOT, X, H, T^2 \}$

Clifford gates are efficiently classical simulatable, the $T$-gate gives universality but is a hard gate to implement in a lab, look for ways of reducing $T$-count.

* May et al. (2013, 2016): phase polynomials for $T$-count optimization in the $\{ CNOT, T\}$ fragment.

In this paper the focus is on CNOT-Dihedral gates, i.e. generated by $\{ CNOT, X, T \}$. It offers a confluence of strategies: groupoid, universal algebra, phase polynomials.

## Brief overview of the paper

The paper proves existence and uniqueness of a normal for the CNOT-dihedral operators, which are defined below [Amy, Chen and Ross. p.86].

An important step is the observation that the operators can be split into two classes: diagonal gates and affine gates. The diagonal gates have a diagonal matrix representations, while the affine ones are affine transformations of the basis states. The gates $X$, $CNOT$ and $SWAP$ are affine, while $\omega$, $T$, $U$ and $V$ are diagonal. Those CNOT-dihedral circuits that only contain affine gates are called affine circuits, and correspondingly for diagonal circuits.

The gates are subject to the following relations. [Amy, Chen and Ross. p.87].

The important aspect to notice here are the degree reduction rules R_1, R_4, R_7, R_8, R_9 and R_10. All of these relations are derivable in the ZX-calculus, making the ZX-calculus a proper fragment thereof.

The normal forms for affine and diagonal circuits turn out to be different, and the overall normal form is a combination of the two. In fact existence and uniqueness of the normal form for affine gates was already proved by [Lafont](http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~lafont/pub/circuits.pdf). Thus, what is proved in the present paper is that
* if an affine gate is to the left of a diagonal gate, the circuit can be rewritten in such a way that the affine gate is the rightmost gate and all the remaining gates are diagonal (i.e. affine gates 'commute' past the diagonal ones),
* diagonal gates commute with diagonal gates,
* any diagonal circuit has a unique normal form.
It then follows that any CNOT-dihedral circuit $C$ can be rearranged so that $C=DA$, where $D$ is a diagonal circuit and $A$ an affine one. Then one can just apply the result of Lafont to $A$ and the last bullet point above to $D$ to get that $C$ has a unique normal form.

**(Lemma)**
Diagonal and affine gates commute.

So the main contribution of the paper is the axiomatisation of diagonal gates in the CNOT-dihedral fragment, this is made easier by the following lemma.

**(Lemma)**
Diagonal gates commute.

The first step towards a normal form is to show that the gates $\{ \omega, T, U, V \} $ generate all diagonal gates in the fragment. They give a small number of relations on these generators which allow to show that they commute with affine gates and between themselves.

The normal form they provide is given by an ordering of the diagonal gates, together with bounds on the number of consecutive gates used, which comes from their representation in terms of phase polynomials. These *degree reductions* are also featured in the axioms and have a direct interpretation in terms of phase polynomial equalities. We will discuss the rules in the following section, and focus on the phase polynomial representations in the third section.


### From ZX to CNOT-Dihedral rules

In order to get an intuition for the presentation given in the paper, we will make a short digression to introduce briefly the ZX calculus. This will allow us to understand the rules exposed in the paper as direct consequences of the underlying rules for logical gates (linear maps) modeled with the ZX calculus. It will also highlight the rules which are not directly derivable from ZX, which we will see come from the phase polynomial formalism.

The ZX calculus is based on (strongly) complementary bases. The generators are

The basic rules encoding strong complementarity are the bialgebra and hopf laws.

**(ZX rules)**

The CNOT-dihedral fragment can be modelled in ZX, it is given by the following representations of the generators.

## Final words

The authors go on to look closer at bicategories of relations inside Grothendieck topoi and abelian categories. Both of these are regular categories, and so fit into the picture we've just painted. However, each have additional properties and structure that compels further study.     

Much of what we have done can be done in greater generality.  For instance, we can drop the local posetal requirement. However, this would greatly complicate matters by requiring non-trivial coherence conditions.
